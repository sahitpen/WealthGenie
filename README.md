## Introduction
The lack of financial literacy is a significant problem in todayâ€™s generation. Investment basics are not taught in most schools, so a large portion of society does not know how to properly manage money. Through WealthGenie, we aim to increase financial awareness by giving users insights into the potential returns they can make by investing their money into different asset classes. In addition, users can dabble in risk-free investing by creating sample portfolios from historical data.
